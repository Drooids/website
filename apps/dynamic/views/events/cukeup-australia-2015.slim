        In the 5 years that CukeUp has been running in London, we have had a diverse
        group of speakers and attendees: Product owners, testers
        and business analysts. You are all fundamental to making BDD work,
        and our programme will reflect that.

      '
        Over both days, the format will switch from short talks to two-hour long workshops.
        The workshops are designed to allow you to dive into specific aspects of BDD
        and Specification by Example that interest you the most. Team up with fellow
        devs, testers, and BAs and work through problems together!
