# Posting Rules

The Cucumber [community forum](https://groups.google.com/group/cukes) has thousands of members.

In order to keep communication efficient we ask you to follow a few rules.
If you follow these guidelines you're more likely to be heard and get a reply.

## 1) Search before you ask

Some questions keep popping up again and again. Do yourself and everyone else a favour by
[searching the archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cukes) for answers before
you ask.

## 2) Use interleaved answers

Consider this discussion - it's not very readable:

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
>>> Top-posting.
>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

If you make the effort to place your follow-up remarks *below* the most relevant section of the text you are replying to,
then reading the conversation becomes a lot easier to read than the above. As a result more people are likely to join the conversation, and there will be fewer misunderstandings.

So instead of "top posting", please use interleaved answers:

>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

>>> Top-posting.

>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.

## 3) Prefix subjects

The Cucumber discussion forum is used to discuss many topics. To help group members quickly decide
whether or not a post is of interest to them, please use a prefix in your subject. Here are some
examples:

* \[JVM\] How can I exclude certain scenarios from a run?
* \[Ruby\] Step Definition doesn't match my step
* \[JS\] Has anyone used Cucumber-JS with Karma?

## 4) Don't hijack threads

If you have a question, don't reply to an existing (irrelevant) message. Start a new topic instead.

## 5) Don't ask individuals

Asking individuals might seem like a good way to get a reply, but it can have the opposite effect:

* Other people might refrain from joining the conversation
* The person you're asking might be too busy to answer

So please address the group, not individuals. Never email people privately for help.
