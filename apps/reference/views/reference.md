TODO: Add some JS that will toggle them when we press the language tabs.

```ruby
Given(/I have (\d+) cukes in my belly/) do |cukes|
  # Do something with the cukes
end
```

```java
@Given("I have (\\d+) cukes in my belly")
public void I_have_cukes_in_my_belly(int cukes) {
    // Do something with the cukes
}
```

```javascript
Given(/^I have (\d+) cukes in my belly$/, function (cukes) {
    // Do something with the cukes
});
```

```csharp
[Given(@"^I have (\d+) cukes in my belly$")]
public void CukesInTheBelly(int cukes)
{
    // Do something with the cukes
}
```
